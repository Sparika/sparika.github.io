  <p>With the advent of technology such as WebRTC, real-time communications are moving to the Internet. This
    disruptive change leads to the emergence of several new, unknown and even invisible actors participating in the
    establishment of a call session. For an end-user, trust in the system becomes blurred and difficult to
    understand.</p>

  <p>We propose a method for modeling and computing the trust that an end-user (or a policy authority) could have in a
    given online communication setup. To this end, we build a user-centric functional decomposition of security
    properties
    and protocols from a communication setup. We use information-theory entropy as a base trust metric and compute
    a global trust value with aggregation operators. This end-value is then returned to the user. </p>

  <p>This survey will be used to evaluate the interest, usefulness, and clarity of our model as a security knowledge
    representation. </p>

  <p>The first half of the survey is dedicated to your current understanding and point-of-view on security issues on the web
    and more precisely related to real time communications. The second half of the survey presents our framework, let
    you play with it on concrete examples, before a series of questions regarding your perception of the way our model
    represents information.
  </p>

  <p>The survey should not take more than ... minutes to complete.</p>

  <p>Thank you for taking some time helping us!</p>

  <legend>Scenario 1 - Weak certificate chain</legend>

  <p>A certificate chain is an ordered hierarchy of digital certificates. In the chain, each certificates is signed by
    a higher level certificate. The top-level certificate is provided by a root certificate authority. This mechanism
    of trust propagation, allows an individuals to verify the validity of a certificate without direct trust in the
    certificate's issuer.</p>

  <p>In practice, root certificates are pre-loaded by browser vendors. When verifying a certificate provided by a web-server,
  a web-browser must verify the validity of the whole certificate chain.</p>

  <p>The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family is often used to sign certificates. SHA-1 is now deemed unsecure and is
  gradually withdrawn from use by Certificate Authority as well as browser vendors.</p>

          width="60%" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></p>

  <p>The above figure represents a certificate chain containing a weak certificate using SHA-1. Arrows represent trust
  relations, i.e. the Browser trusts the Root CA, which in turn trusts the CA. This last CA trust the Web Site owner
  (as to be the owner of the domain). This allows, in theory, the browser to establish a transitive trust relationship
  to the actual web server.</p>

  <legend>Scenario 2 - Transport Layer Security</legend>

  <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocols used to ensure communications security over various
  applications.</p>

  <p>Communications security includes properties of privacy, authentication and integrity.
    In TLS privacy is provided by symmetric cryptography (e.g. with AES), authentication by public
    key cryptography (e.g. with RSA), and data integrity with Message Authentication Code (for instance with HMAC-SHA-1).</p>

  <legend>Scenario 3 - Audio-Video communications</legend>

  <p>We would like to compare the trust you may have in current real-time communication scenario with the trust you
    would have in different WebRTC scenarios.</p>

  <p>WebRTC is an API developped by the W3C for browser-to-browser communications. It allows for usages such as
    voice call, video call, and file sharing. As an API provided by web-browser it doesn't require third-party plugins
    and could be deployed by any web server. Any websites could become is own Communication Service Provider (CSP).</p>

  <p>WebRTC establishes a communication between two web-browsers in a peer-to-peer fashion but still requires signalling
    messages to be exchanged by participant through one or more CSPs.</p>

  <p>The draft also specifies a way for call-participants to exchange identity assertion provided by a third-party
  Identity Provider (IdP). i.e. Alice would authenticate to Bob through an IdP independant from the CSP. In this case, one of the claims
  is that it is not required for users to trust CSPs in order to establish a secure communication.</p>

  <div class="help-block">
  <p>We propose a method for modeling and computing the trust that an end-user (or a policy authority) could have in a given online communication setup.
    To this end, we build a user-centric functional decomposition of security properties and protocols from a communication setup.
    We use information-theory entropy as a base trust metric and compute a global trust value with aggregation operators.

  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><b>Functional Decomposition Model<br/></b> We observe that security algorithms or protocols serve one or more objectives,
      and expect that some properties be fulfilled by other protocols. For instance a protocol may be used to provide a
      confidential exchange between Alice and Bob but would require Bob to be authenticated beforehand in order to be secure.
      These security algorithms also rely on random values such as cryptographic keys, hash digest, etc.</p>

    <p>We decompose a security configuration into several <b>components</b>. Each components <b>fulfill requirements and require
    requirements</b> provided by other components. One of the requirement is the root of our decomposition tree, i.e. the
    security property expected from the configuration. Some of these requirements are leaf of the decomposition tree,
    we call them <b>primitives</b>. They represent security objects such as cryptographic keys or hash digest.
    As such they can be <b>assigned entropy value</b> representing their resistance against attack.</p>

    <p><b>Computational Model</b><br/>
      In order to compute the security level of a requirement realized by a component, we define aggregation operators
      at the component level. Working from bottom to top, we use these operators to compute the value of the root. These
      aggregation operators, set on a component, take requirements and primitives security value as input and return a
      single security value which is associated to the component parent requirement.</p>

    <p>Based on our observations and models from the literature we use two operators: <b>Weakest Link (MIN)</b> and
      <b>Additive (SUM)</b> operators.</p>
  </div>


  <p class="col-md-6">
  <p><b>Entropy Metric</b><br/>
    <p>It is possible to estimate at which computational cost a component is deemed secure. Based on this estimation a
      minimum entropy level can be defined for each cryptographic primitives. In practice we could likewise use
      recommendation provided by third-party (e.g. ANSSI RGS). We define our <b>security scale as a range on [0; 1]</b> with 0 meaning no
      security and 1 meaning adequate protection [Lenstra, 2004].
      Entropy values are then normalized with respect to the recommended minimum entropy. Value greater than their recommendation are normalized to 1.

    <p>On this figure, the AES components fulfill a confidentiality requirement between A and B while it requires requirements
    for integrity and authentication between A and B. It also relies on an AES 256 key primitives.
    A MIN operation is applied to all its requirements and primitives to compute the value of the fulfilled requirement.</p>

  <div class="help-block">
    <p>We also want to fit the trust model to the user point-of-view, its own subjectivity. To this end we add, on top of our model, an optional trust layer
    expressing the trust that the user has in other actors.</p>
  </div>
    <p><b>Subjective weighting<br/></b> Our standard model considers the difficulty for an attacker to mount an attack on
      one of the properties expected by the user. Trust can be interpreted as a ”subjective probability with which an
      agent will perform a particular action”. We consider actors not behaving as expected as attackers themselves.
      Indeed they could be cooperating with an attacker, actively or unintentionally. Their position in the chain of
      operations may give them important advantages on mounting these attacks. We thus compute the security expected
      value (in the sense of probability theory). Practically,
      this means that the security expected value is the trust-weighted average of its objective security value (genuine
      actor) and zero (actor as an attacker).</p>

  <p class="help-block">We won't details much further how we apply this trust layer. However you can use our dynamic model to see how it works
  and what influence each actor has on the overall security level. Three pre-configured scenarios, matching earlier questions,
    have also been setup.
